# Sparks!

A Sparked by Resistance Discord bot.

(she/her)

Sparks uses [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) to talk to Discord, and currently supports Forged in the Dark, Sparked by Resistance, and Powered by the Apocalypse rolls. Invite her to your Discord [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=968292422046064691&permissions=277025392640&scope=bot%20applications.commands), and find a full index of her commands [here](help-text.md). Thanks to [River Ray](https://riverray.itch.io) for adding Wild Words support.

(A brief note: the official help text asks users to report issues on Sparks' itch.io page. You're welcome to file them here as well, but of course that requires a Github account, and Sparks' users are more likely to have itch accounts than Github accounts.)
