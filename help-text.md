Hi! This is the help info for Sparks, the indie TRPG Discord bot.

Sparks' dice-rolling commands are all subcommands of `/roll`. For example, `/roll sbr fallout` rolls a Sparked by Resistance fallout test. Her full list of commands is as follows:

- `/roll sbr check`: rolls a Sparked by Resistance check. Requires the number of d10s to toll.

- `/roll sbr fallout`: rolls a Sparked by Resistance fallout test.

- `/roll forged`: rolls a Forged in the Dark roll. Requires both the number of d6s to roll and the type of roll.

- `/roll pbta`: rolls a Powered by the Apocalypse move. Requires the stat, including any bonuses to the roll (i.e. +1 forwards/ongoings, move-related bonuses, etc.)

- `/roll wild`: rolls a Wild Words roll. Requires both the number of d6s to roll and the type of roll, and optionally the number of dice to cut.

- `/roll custom`: rolls any number of dice with any number of sides. Requires the number of dice and the number of sides per die (all dice will be rolled with the same number of sides.) Doesn't accept negative numbers.

- `/buzz`: Sparks will reply with "Zap!"

- `/flicker`: Sparks will reply with "Hummmmmmmmmm...", like the sound of a flickering fluorescent light.

- `/sparks-help`: Sparks will reproduce these instructions.

Note: The `/roll` command currently treats negative numbers as zeros for FitD and SbR games, since most of these games don't really deal with negative pools in their rules.
